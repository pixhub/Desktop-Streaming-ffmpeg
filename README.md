This script uses ffmpeg to create videos of your desktop, with sound and microphone (to make tutorials for example) and save it to your private directory.
You need to make a change on the video saving path. Just put your account name instead of "account_name"
The default file extension I put is .mpg. You also can use .flv to make flash videos for example.
To stop the stream, just press "Q" on your terminal.
