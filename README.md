These scripts uses ffmpeg to create videos of your desktop, with sound and microphone (to make tutorials for example) and save it to your private directory, and are able to stream your desktop to a streaming platform like Twitch.com

You need to make changes like put your account name instead of "pixhub", or your Twitch Stream Key to make these scripts able on your configuration.

To stop the stream, just press "Q" on your terminal.
