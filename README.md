These scripts uses ffmpeg to create videos of your desktop, with sound and microphone (to make tutorials for example) and save it to your private directory, and are able to stream your desktop to a streaming platform like Twitch.com

Also, in the Wiki section, I show you how to make your own Nginx Streaming Server, and how to use Docker as virtualisation tool to emb nginx in a container on your computer.

You may need to make changes like put your account name instead of `pixhub`, or your `Twitch-Stream-Key` to make these scripts able on your configuration.

Please read the Wiki documentation for more information https://github.com/pixhub/Desktop-Streaming-ffmpeg/wiki

To stop the stream, just press `Q` on your terminal.
